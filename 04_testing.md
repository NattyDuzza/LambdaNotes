## User Simulation Testing

The following sections will document how I went about carrying out the test plans described in the test planning section of *Design*.



## Stakeholder Testing 

### Pre-Test Interviews

I briefed all my stakeholders on the current state of the project, and decided to ask them a few questions before they decided to test.

**The Questions**:

- Q1: How are you feeling about testing LambdaNotes?

- Q2.1: (For Rupert and Alex) - Have any of your opinions on revision changed since we last spoke?

- Q2.2: (For Gretchen) - Have you tried any new methods of planning since we last spoke?

- Q3: Have you thought of anything else you'd like in LambdaNotes that could be implemented at a later date, before you actually test the software?

**Rupert**:

- Q1: "I'm looking forward to it. It could be helpful."

- Q2: "I've started to do slightly more. I've actually used mind maps more after we talked about them in our first interview. Flashcards still seem like a lot of effort though."

- Q3: "No, I'm going in with an open mind."

**Alex**:

- Q1: "I'm excited, I've enjoyed seeing it come together and I'm looking forward to finally being able to try using it. I know it is only a preliminary build but it will be interesting to see its potential."

- Q2: "I've stuck to my method of revision, I haven't felt the need to change anything since it has been working well. However, I am not opposed to the idea of incorporating this new software into my routine."

- Q3: "
