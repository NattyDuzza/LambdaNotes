# LambdaNotes

## Introduction

LambdaNotes is a piece of software created for my A-Level Computer Science NEA.

The code is yet to be refactored and, as such, may not be elegant to more experienced programmer. This is of not of worry to me however; the aim of this is to simply create a working prototype upon which I may, or may not, work on in the years to come.

Please see the rest of the README for details on how to use and navigate the program.
