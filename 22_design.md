### Flashcard Selection Algorithm

It can be argued that the most important algorithm in the flashcard section of LambdaNotes is the actual algorithm that dictates the order the flashcards are presented to the user for review. 

I will design two algorithms which work differently, and then test this using one of my stakeholders (Alex) to see what he finds the most useful. I will then change this into a computational equivalent (turn the pseudocode/flowchart into Python code and embed it in the GUI).

#### Brainstorming  

To initially come up with ideas of how the algorithms could work, I used paper to layout possible ideas:
