# Analysis
## Problem Identification
### Problem Description
As computational technology has progressed, it has been used increasingly in tasks that previously would have been done on paper. 
A classic example is the process of studying. Note taking is often classed as an essential part of this, and a number of note-taking applications have been created. 
When we look over pre-existing note taking application, we will see that they can be somewhat overwhelming, advocating for a high number of features rather than raw efficiency and usability. LambdaNotes will be designed to have a slim, clean GUI where information input is quick and easy, so that students can prioritise quanitity and not have the option to waste time making a 'pretty looking' workspace.

### Computational Suitability
This planned application lends itself to a computational solution since it is aimed at running on a computer system, removing the need for excessive amounts of paper and materials. The computer program should be able to take in a prompt, and then continually ask for linked information, keeping track of which 'nodes' link to which, and be able to return this information in a variety of text-based and graphical ways.

## Potential End-Users and Stakeholders
The clientelle this application will be aimed at includes students, event planners and anyone looking to brainstorm. 

### Applications
#### Studying
This program will be optimal for this purpose. It will streamline a student's revision by making it easier for said student to link all the information they need to remember together. An article published by the University of Malta states 'we live in an information age which means that our problem is less one of obtaining and more of retaining and organizing all the information that we are required to ingest' and 'Mind maps offer a dynamic learning method to keep students attention, engage students in a fun, creative way, improve information retention, and recall abilities.' (Grech, 2016, pp. 108). Furthermore, an article in Nurse Education Today states 'The use of mind maps incorporated into an assessment strategy and programme is an innovative way of facilitating students to understand key information. Mind maps have the potential to provide students with a strategy for retaining information, integrating critical thinking and problem solving skills.' (Noonan, 2013).


All of this points to the advantages of using a mind-map note taking system in this context. This will be the main focus that the program is tailored towards, however it will not be incompatible with stakeholders from other areas of usability.

#### Business Applications
In an article from the *Journal of Contemporary Management Research* states 'Mind Maps can actually facilitate the 
core business skills â€“ such as choosing from among alternatives, organizing one's own and also other's ideas, analyzing, defining and 
solving problems, using hindsight and foresight, restructuring business(es), negotiations, risk controlling, 
setting and meeting time and financial targets. 
A Mind Map can indeed be a time-saving and cost-saving tool. A Mind Map enables the presenter to capture key points and
organize the flow of the message.' (Buzan, 2011).
Hence one can observe that the program will have applications in this sector as well. Users will be able keep track of ideas, and have tools to be able to filter through these, as well as innotive ways to gain inspiration by observing links between items that they may have not realised had they not used a mind map layout.

Rupert is attends a non-selective state school. 

##### Interview - Standard Questions


- Q: Would you class yourself as a enthusiastic student?

  A: No, I find myself not enjoying school most of the time. I always look forward to the weekend. 

- Q: How much time would you say you study for a week outside of school (not including homework)?

  A: Probably less than an hour. 

- Q: When you do partake in revision, what techniques do you use currently?

  A: I usually just read my textbooks. It takes the least effort!

- Q: What experience do you have using mindmaps? Do you like them?

  A: Not a lot, I've done them in class before when the teacher has set it as a task. I think they are better than normal notes. 

- Q: Would you be more likely to make notes on paper or digitally?
 
  A: Digitally, I think. Keeping loads of paper about is annoying. I also prefer typing than writing with a pen et cetera. 

- Q: What experience do you have with digital notetaking apps?

  A: None. I've made notes on Word once before for homework, but I haven't used any apps specifically made for the purpose.

- Q: What would you look for in a digital notetaking application?

  A: Something quick. I want to able to get a lot of revision done in a short time so I can get on with other things.


##### Interview - Personalised Questions


- Q: You said you think mind maps are better than normal notes. Why is that? 

  A: I like how they can develop quickly, and you don't have to copy out loads of information to make them useful. 

- Q: Do you think if you found a 'low-effort' way of revising, you would try to use it consistently?

  A: Yes. It would be good because I can say I've done revision without spending hours copying out a textbook.

- Q: Finally, you said you had used Word for notetaking, how was that experience?

  A: Very boring. It's no different to just copying notes down on paper really.
